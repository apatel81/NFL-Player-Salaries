# NFL-Player-Salaries

This project began right after Carolina Panthers All-Pro RB, Christian McCaffrey, signed his lucrative 4 year, $64 million contract making him the highest paid player in history for his position. Naturally, I was curious to know if his, and other NFL players, were worthy of their 2019 contracts based on their 2019 season statistics.
In order to collect the data, I had to scrape the data from two different sources: player data from NFL.com and salary data from overthecap.com. I used Python in Juypter Notebooks to collect both data. Due to the fact that there are different positions in NFL and a player's salary is indicative of the position they play, I collected the data by position and conducted my analyses by position.
After data collection, I began my regression analysis in R, first by clustering players based on their performance. I then proceeded to fit linear models using different season statistics as predictors, added quadratic terms, centered and standardized variables, and ran best subsets to create a model that best fit the data. Now for each position in the NFL, I have a measure for comparing if each player is being overpaid or underpaid based on their 2019 performance.
